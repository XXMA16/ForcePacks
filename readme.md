# ForcePacks

This is a very basic Velocity plugin which kicks players who don't accept the Server Resource Pack.

Players can bypass this if they have the permission `forcepacks.bypass`

To grant permissions to players use a permission plugin like [LuckPerms](https://forums.velocitypowered.com/t/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin/75)

This plugin is compatible with [VelocityResourcepacks](https://forums.velocitypowered.com/t/velocityresourcepacks-manage-resourcepacks-for-servers-and-whole-proxy/515)
